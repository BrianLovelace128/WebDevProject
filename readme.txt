Download Node.js installer from:
    https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Install:
    This will install Node and Npm:
        Node is the runtime environment which will allow you to run your javascript code on
        the server.

        Npm (Node Package Manager) is an application which will help you manage and install
        third party Node modules like Express.

Create a new directory for the project.

Get this code to that directory. If you are using a unix based shell you may type this command:
    git clone https://github.com/BrianLovelace128/WebDevProject.git

Open the node shell (or powershell or a unix terminal) and navigate to this directory.
Now try to run this command:
    node server.js


^^ This should fail with a "ReferenceError: expressed is not defined"

Express is a module used by the server. You must first install this module and make it accessible
to the node runtime.

You can do this using Npm. Type:
    npm install express --save

Once it's done you will see a series messages showing you all the things that it did. If you type
"ls" into the shell, you should also see that a new file called node_modules has been created. 
    DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE! It is for node's internal book keeping.

Now you have configured node to run your server. So lets try to start it again:
    node server.js

You should now see the following output on your shell:
    Server running at http://localhost:8080
